a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied: This code uses basic HTML form elements to create a seminar registration form. Key concepts include using <input> fields for text, date, radio buttons, email, password, phone, and time, as well as a <select> dropdown for meal preference. Labels are provided for each input to ensure clarity and improve accessibility.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: Through this exercise, I practiced ensuring proper form element syntax, which is crucial for form functionality and validation. I also refined my understanding of form field attributes like type, required, and name, which play essential roles in data handling and user input validation.

b) Reflection
What I Learned: This project reinforced the importance of correct syntax when creating HTML forms. Each form input type has specific characteristics that can improve user experience, such as type="email" for validating email formats and type="radio" for single-choice options. I also learned about the label element, which is essential for accessibility, linking each label to its corresponding input.

Challenges Faced and Solutions: I encountered syntax issues, especially with incorrect attribute placements in radio buttons and submit buttons (e.g., Name"gender" instead of name="gender"). These errors caused the form to malfunction. To fix them, I carefully reviewed and corrected each attribute, ensuring they adhered to standard HTML syntax.

c) Clarity & Coherence
The explanation is organized by each instruction, with clear and concise descriptions of concepts applied, new skills learned, and challenges faced. The response is coherent and easy to follow, addressing each instruction logically and effectively.
