a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied: This code uses HTML to display a list of college events, each with details such as the location and time. It employs ordered lists (<ol>) to display the main events in sequence and unordered lists (<ul>) nested within each event to list the location and time. The use of nested lists makes the structure more organized and easier to read, separating each event’s details.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: Through this exercise, I learned how to use nested lists effectively to organize related information under each event. I also gained more experience in using the class attribute to apply CSS styles (though the specific styles are not provided here), which can help differentiate event details such as location and time. Additionally, I saw the importance of semantic HTML and proper nesting of elements to maintain a clear structure.

b) Reflection
What I Learned: This project reinforced my understanding of how to organize event information hierarchically, starting with the main event name and breaking it down into smaller pieces (location, time). I also learned how to use nested lists within ordered lists to represent structured data. This approach allows users to easily scan through a list of events with key details grouped under each heading.

Challenges Faced and Solutions: One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the nested unordered lists displayed properly within the ordered list. I overcame this by correctly nesting the <ul> elements inside each <li>. I also had to ensure the correct placement of the closing tags and check that the structure was logical for better styling (though styling through CSS is not shown in the code provided).

c) Clarity & Coherence
The explanation is clear, concise, and well-organized. Each section addresses the key aspects of the HTML code logically, making it easy to follow and understand the key concepts. The writing is coherent and straightforward, ensuring clarity in explaining the code’s structure and the lessons learned.
