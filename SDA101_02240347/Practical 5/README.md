1. Overview
The HTML code is designed to display a list of college events, including their names, locations, and times. It uses ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists for organization.

2. Key Concepts Applied
Ordered and Unordered Lists: Used to structure events and their details.
Semantic HTML: The <h1> tag is used for the main heading, although it isn’t correctly closed.
CSS Classes: External styles are applied using the class attributes.
3. Challenges and Solutions
Improper Closing of <h1> Tag: The <h1> tag isn’t closed, which could cause layout issues. This can be fixed by properly closing the tag.
Incorrect link Tag for Image: The <link> tag references an HTML file instead of a CSS file. This should be corrected.
Indentation: Lack of proper indentation can reduce code readability. Adjusting indentation would improve clarity.
4. Conclusion
The code functions but needs adjustments to improve structure and readability. Proper tag closures and correcting the use of <link> will enhance the webpage's effectiveness.
