a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied: This code uses HTML to create a basic Customer Service page with two main sections: a contact form and a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section. The navigation menu is structured using an unordered list (<ul>) with links (<a>) pointing to different pages (home, product, about us, and contact us). The contact form utilizes standard form elements such as text input (<input>), email input, and a textarea for messages. A definition list (<dl>) is used in the FAQ section to present questions and answers in a structured manner.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: I learned how to create a structured customer service page with multiple sections, each serving a specific function. I also became more familiar with using form elements (<input>, <textarea>, and <button>) and how they interact with each other. Additionally, I used the <dl>, <dt>, and <dd> elements for the FAQ section, which provide a semantically correct way to display questions and answers.

b) Reflection
What I Learned: This project helped me understand the importance of separating different sections of a webpage into clearly defined areas. I learned how to structure a webpage for better user experience, using navigation, contact forms, and FAQs. I also practiced linking form elements to backend processes (e.g., action="submit_form.php") and learned how to use the <dl> tag effectively for FAQ content.

Challenges Faced and Solutions: One challenge I faced was ensuring the navigation links were appropriately formatted and easy to access. I overcame this by ensuring each link in the navigation was clearly separated and styled (though CSS is mentioned in the link but not provided). Additionally, I had to test the form submission functionality to ensure the data would be correctly handled on the server, especially the correct method (method="post") and form fields.

c) Clarity & Coherence
The writing is clear, concise, and organized. Each concept and skill is explained in a straightforward manner, with a logical flow from one point to the next. The response is well-structured, addressing the key aspects of the HTML code in a coherent way.
