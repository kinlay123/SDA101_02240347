a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied: This webpage utilizes HTML to create a well-organized overview of semester-related information using various types of lists. Key concepts applied include unordered and ordered lists for structuring information hierarchically. Lists are used for the course overview, daily schedule, weekly to-do items, and study goals, with nested lists for more detailed breakdowns within each study goal topic.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: This project improved my understanding of when to use ordered vs. unordered lists. I also gained familiarity with nesting lists, which allows for more structured content by breaking down topics into subtopics, such as dividing programming concepts into variables, control structures, and functions. This approach enhances readability and organization.

b) Reflection
What I Learned: I learned to create organized, readable HTML documents using lists and headings effectively. By applying nested lists, I was able to structure complex information hierarchically, making it easier for users to navigate the content.

Challenges Faced and Solutions: One challenge I faced was getting the nested lists to align properly and visually separate from the main list items. To resolve this, I used CSS (not shown here) to add padding and adjust list styles, ensuring better readability and structure.

c) Clarity & Coherence
The response is organized by each instruction, with clear, concise explanations of concepts applied, skills learned, and challenges faced. The writing is coherent and easy to follow, presenting each point logically.
