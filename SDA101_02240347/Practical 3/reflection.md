a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied: This code uses HTML to structure and organize semester-related information into various sections. It employs unordered lists (<ul>) and ordered lists (<ol>) to present courses, daily schedules, to-do items, and study goals. The nested lists are used to break down complex topics like study goals into more detailed subtopics, which improves readability and organization.

New Skills or Knowledge Acquired: Through this exercise, I learned how to use both unordered lists for general lists and ordered lists for sequential information, such as a daily schedule. Additionally, I learned to nest ordered lists within unordered lists, which allows for structuring hierarchical content, such as breaking down study goals into specific topics and subtopics.

b) Reflection
What I Learned: This project helped me understand how to organize information in a logical and structured way using HTML lists. It reinforced the importance of clear organization in presenting data, especially when dealing with multiple topics, such as semester schedules and to-do lists. I also learned how to improve accessibility and readability by appropriately using headings (<h1>, <h2>) and different types of lists.

Challenges Faced and Solutions: One challenge I faced was ensuring the nested lists (for study goals) displayed properly, with the subtopics indented clearly. To overcome this, I ensured the proper use of nested <ol> elements within <ul> tags. I also focused on ensuring the correct nesting of content to avoid confusion and improve visual clarity.

c) Clarity & Coherence
The writing is clear, concise, and well-organized, addressing the key elements of the HTML code in a structured manner. Each part of the code is explained logically, making it easy to follow the main concepts, skills learned, and challenges faced. The response is coherent, with a focus on clarity in presenting the concepts and their applications.
